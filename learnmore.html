    <h2>5 things that I love about the Church:</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li id="F1">The Godhead
            <ul> 
                <li>We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. </li>
                <li>God is our Heavenly Father, even the Father of our spirits. We are all His children.</li>
                <li>Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten Son of the Father, our Elder Brother, the Savior and Redeemer of the world, and the Leader of this/His Church.</li>
                <li>The Holy Ghost is the bearer and messenger of all truth, through whom we may know the truth of all things.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="F2">Covenants
            <ul>
                <li>We can connect and bind ourselves to, as well as develop personal relationships with these 3 beings/personages through sacred covenants.</li>
                <li>Covenants are made through ordinances which are performed by the authority and power of the Holy Priesthood.</li>
                <li>As we make and keep covenants, we enter into and remain on the covenant path, which is the path that leads to Eternal Life, the greatest of all gifts.</li>
                <li>Eternal Life is the quality of life that God lives. It entails living with our Heavenly Father, His Son, The Holy Ghost, and our families forever.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="F3">Living Prophets
            <ul>
                <li>We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.</li>
                <li>We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</li>
                <li>We also believe in the Holy Scriptures, which teach us that God sends Prophets and Apostles to deliver gospel truths to his Children. The same Scriptures teach that God is the same "yesterday, today, and forever." </li>
                <li>Joseph Smith was the first Prophet of this dispensation. His duty was to begin the restoration of Christ's Church and Gospel in its fullness. This commencement began in 1820, with "the First Vision." </li>
                <li>Including Joseph Smith there have been 17 Prophets in total during this dispensation. They have led the Church, with the additional aid of their Counselors in the First Presidency, 12 Apostles called and ordained of God, General Authorities and Officers of the Church, and other local Church Leaders. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="F1">Temples
            <ul> 
                <li>Temples are sacred structures in which we worship the Lord. Each Temple is the House of the Lord.</li>
                <li>In Temples we perform sacred ordinances and make sacred covenants, both for ourselves and for our ancestors.</li>
                <li>There are 315 Temples either announced, under construction, or built and running on earth.</li>
                <li>They are a place in which one can find a peace that passeth all understanding. They are a refuge from the world. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="F1">The Scriptures
            <ul> 
                <li>We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God. </li>
                <li>Both Sacred Books are avialble to the public and you can find them simply, and most likely by "asking, seeking, or knocking" at any local book distributor. Read them, and you will come to know for yourself that the things mentioned above are all true.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
