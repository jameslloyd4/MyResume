                            <p style="font-size: smaller;">GRIX is a Venture Capital Firm based out of Sugarhouse, SLC. It focuses primarily on leading pre-seed rounds for B2B SaaS Startups that are mission driven. As an Intern, I have worked closely with the Founder, Randall Lloyd, who has much business and VC experience. With his MBA from Stanford, as well as experience at Salesforce, Ebay, and other big companies, he is a Leader to many and a Mentor to me. I have helped GRIX by sourcing deals, analyzing data, creating useful spreadsheets and documents, as well as helping build the portfolio/fund, not just in size, but in strength. GRIX has proved to be a very beneficial kickstart to my career, and I hope that GRIX too has benefited from me.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Full-Time Missionary</div>
                            <p style="font-size: smaller;">In both Jacksonville Florida and Barranquilla Colombia (majority of time spent here), I had the privelege of serving for 2+ years as a Full-Time Representative of Jesus Christ and His Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This experience taught me many things, including the language of Spanish, in which I am now fluent, as well as organizational, management and interpersonal skills. From walking on dirt roads and staying in shabby shacks, to building backyards and fixing homes, to working in offices operating the logistics of the organization, my mission provided me with many memorable moments and educational experiences. I worked closely with 2 different Presidents of the Mission Colombia Barranquilla and their sweet wives to help lead the mission and other missionaries in the right direction. In doing so, I was blessed with much mentorship and many life lessons. Lastly, I believe I learned the principles of people... How to teach others, how to learn from others, how to love others, and how to serve others. This is no prestigious professional position, but in my opinion there is no greater experience that a young man can obtain in preparing for his adulthood.</p>

                    <p>I am young and enthusiastic. There is much more to come and that is something that excites and energizes me. I have many different passions, interests, and talents outside of my limited experience and education. I love the studious life, yet I also love the social life. I love to learn, yet I also love to teach. I love the outdoors (particularly skiing, team sports, and spending time at my cabin in Driggs, Idaho), yet I also love the indoors (particularly making and playing music, watching movies, and reading/writing). I think of myself as a Swiss Army Knife, because I enjoy doing all things, but I am not especially specialized in any. I do my best to sieze each day. I do my best to live in accordance with my father's teaching that "life is about people, not things." I do my best to live well rounded and consistently challenge myself to that I grow and progress. I do my best to make good decisions daily, because I know they determine my destiny. To me, and to my Dad, who was and is my Hero, that is what it means to "Live Rich" (my Dad's legacy and life motto he left us, before passing away at age 35). Above all, my Faith, Family and Future are the things most important to me, and they always will be.   </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">One of my biggest passions right now is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. <a href="../startbootstrap-resume-gh-pages/learnmore.html">Click here to learn more about my passion.</a></p>
